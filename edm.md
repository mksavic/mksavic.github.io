# EDM

> It's always been much more than that  
> Music is touching generations  
> Liberating cultures  
> Make people fall in love  
> Make people cry  
> It's true emotion  
> So, when people ask why my song has that timeless feel to them?  
> That's what I need to explain  
> It's on the very nature of how I write my songs
