## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="mksavic.jpg">

I am a first-year graduate student working towards my Master's in Computer Science (with thesis) at NYU's [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/). My current research focuses on exploring the feasibility and efficiency of taint-driven embedded software fuzzing. I am advised by [Brendan Dolan-Gavitt](http://moyix.net/). I'm also currently working for [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/), and am a [Critical Skills Master's Program](https://www.sandia.gov/careers/special_programs/critical_skills_program.html) fellow.
